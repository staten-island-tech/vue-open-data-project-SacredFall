Step 1: Identify Core Functionalities

    Review Chart.js Documentation: Understand the different graph types and their data requirements.
    Examine Existing Database Structure: Check what data is available in your repository and how it can be visualized.
    Identify Common Use Cases: Determine the most relevant data views and user needs for visualizations.

Step 2: Plan the Tabs and Views

    List Potential Graph Views:
        Line Charts for time series data.
        Bar Charts for categorical data comparisons.
        Pie/Donut Charts for showing proportions.
        Scatter Plots for showing relationships between variables.
        Radar Charts for multi-variable comparisons.
    Design Taskbar Layout:
        Create tabs for each graph view.
        Consider adding filtering options and data selection features.
    Create Wireframes for Each Tab:
        Visualize the user interface for each tab.
        Include placeholders for charts, data tables, and controls.

Follow-up Steps

    Validate Design and Views: Get feedback from potential users to ensure the planned views meet their needs.
    Detailed Implementation Planning: Plan the development of each tab in detail.
